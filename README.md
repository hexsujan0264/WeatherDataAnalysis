# WeatherDataAnalysis
This project is a simple data analysis of weather data, which aims to gain insights into temperature and precipitation trends in a particular location.
Data
The data used in this project was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and includes daily temperature and precipitation measurements from 2010 to 2020. The data is stored in a CSV file with the following columns: date, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation.

Methodology
To analyze the weather data, we used Python and its libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. We started by importing the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and then cleaned and preprocessed the data. Next, we calculated daily and monthly average temperature and precipitation values and plotted them using Matplotlib.

Results
Our analysis revealed several interesting trends in the weather data. We found that temperatures have been increasing over the past decade, with a particularly significant increase in the summer months. We also found that precipitation has been decreasing over time, with a significant decrease in the winter months.

Visualizations
We created several visualizations to help illustrate our findings. These include line graphs showing the trend in temperature and precipitation over time, as well as bar graphs showing the average monthly values of temperature and precipitation.

Running the Code
To run the code, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine, as well as the following libraries: pandas, matplotlib, and numpy. To reproduce the results, simply clone this repository and run the weather_analysis.py file.

shell
Copy code
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-data-analysis.git
$ cd weather-data-analysis
$ python weather_analysis.py
The output will be a series of graphs showing the temperature and precipitation trends over time.
